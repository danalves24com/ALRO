#+TITLE: ALRO Project

* Idea
Evaluate an algorithm based on certain characteristics.
** Pitch
Self-singable algorithm rating.


* ALRO score
+ 0 - 10 scale
** Properties
+ Algorithm efficiency (execution time)
+ Uniqueness
  + Evaluation based on how many other algorithms with matching tags exist
+ Casing Performance

* Functionality

** Generating
+ Create .ALRO file and .alro directory
** Scoring Setup
+ Create inputs


** Efficiency Measure
1. Add runtime hooks to all key algorithms
2. Add evaluator to the end of the program
4. Run full Program
   1. At the end of program
      Evaluate run times and save them to .alro
